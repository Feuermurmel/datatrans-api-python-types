    "description": "Welcome to the Datatrans API reference.\nThis document is meant to be used in combination with https://docs.datatrans.ch.\nAll the parameters used in the curl and web samples are described here.\nReach out to support@datatrans.ch if something is missing or unclear.\n\nLast updated: 12.10.22 - 15:36 UTC\n\n# Payment Process\nThe following steps describe how transactions are processed with Datatrans.\nWe separate payments in three categories: Customer-initiated payments, merchant-initiated payments and after the payment.\n\n## Customer Initiated Payments\nWe have three integrations available: [Redirect](https://docs.datatrans.ch/docs/redirect-lightbox),\n[Lightbox](https://docs.datatrans.ch/docs/redirect-lightbox) and [Secure Fields](https://docs.datatrans.ch/docs/secure-fields).\n\n### Redirect & Lightbox\n- Send the required parameters to initialize a `transactionId` to the [init](#operation/init) endpoint.\n- Let the customer proceed with the payment by redirecting them to the correct link - or showing them your payment form.\n  - Redirect: Redirect the browser to the following URL structure\n    ```\n    https://pay.sandbox.datatrans.com/v1/start/transactionId\n    ```\n  - Lightbox: Load the JavaScript library and initialize the payment form:\n    ```js\n    <script src=\"https://pay.sandbox.datatrans.com/upp/payment/js/datatrans-2.0.0.js\">\n    ```\n    ```js\n    payButton.onclick = function() {\n      Datatrans.startPayment({\n        transactionId:  \"transactionId\"\n      });\n    };\n    ```\n- Your customer proceeds with entering their payment information and finally hits the pay or continue button.\n- For card payments, we check the payment information with your acquirers. The acquirers check the payment information with the issuing parties.\nThe customer proceeds with 3D Secure whenever required.\n- Once the transaction is completed, we return all relevant information\nto you (check our [Webhook section](#section/Webhook) for more details).\nThe browser will be redirected to the success, cancel or error URL with our `datatransTrxId` in the response.\n\n### Secure Fields\n- Send the required parameters to initialize a transactionId to our [secureFieldsInit](#operation/secureFieldsInit) endpoint.\n- Load the Secure Fields JavaScript libarary and initialize Secure Fields:\n  ```js\n  <script src=\"https://pay.sandbox.datatrans.com/upp/payment/js/secure-fields-2.0.0.js\">\n  ```\n  ```js\n  var secureFields = new SecureFields();\n  secureFields.init(\n    {{transactionId}}, {\n        cardNumber: \"cardNumberPlaceholder\",\n        cvv: \"cvvPlaceholder\",\n    });\n  ```\n- Handle the success event of the secureFields.submit() call.\n- If 3D authentication is required for a specific transaction, the `redirect` property inside the `data`\nobject will indicate the URL that the customer needs to be redirected to.\n- Use the [Authorize an authenticated transaction](#operation/authorize-split)endpoint to fully authorize\nthe Secure Fields transaction. This is required to finalize the authorization process with Secure Fields.\n\n## Merchant Initiated Payments\nOnce you have processed a customer-initiated payment or registration you can call our API to process\nrecurring payments. Check our [authorize](#operation/authorize) endpoint to see how to create a recurring\npayment or our [validate](#operation/validate) endpoint to validate your customers’ saved payment details.\n\n## After the payment\nUse the `transactionId` to check the [status](#operation/status) and to [settle](#operation/settle),\n[cancel](#operation/cancel) or [refund](#operation/credit) a transaction.\n\n# Idempotency\n\nTo retry identical requests with the same effect without accidentally performing the same operation more than needed,\nyou can add the header `Idempotency-Key` to your requests. This is useful when API calls are disrupted or you did not\nreceive a response. In other words, retrying identical requests with our idempotency key will not have any side effects.\nWe will return the same response for any identical request that includes the same idempotency key.\n\nIf your request failed to reach our servers, no idempotent result is saved because no API endpoint processed your request.\nIn such cases, you can simply retry your operation safely. Idempotency keys remain stored for 60 minutes. After 60 minutes\nhave passed, sending the same request together with the previous idempotency key will create a new operation.\n\nPlease note that the idempotency key has to be unique for each request and has to be defined by yourself. We recommend\nassigning a random value as your idempotency key and using UUID v4. Idempotency is only available for `POST` requests.\n\nIdempotency was implemented according to the [\"The Idempotency HTTP Header Field\" Internet-Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-idempotency-header-01.html)\n\n|Scenario|Condition|Expectation|\n|:---|:---|:---|\n|First time request|Idempotency key has not been seen during the past 60 minutes.|The request is processed normally.|\n|Repeated request|The request was retried after the first time request completed.| The response from the first time request will be returned.|\n|Repeated request|The request was retried before the first time request completed.| 409 Conflict. It is recommended that clients time their retries using an exponential backoff algorithm.|\n|Repeated request|The request body is different than the one from the first time request.| 422 Unprocessable Entity.|\n\nExample:\n```sh\ncurl -i 'https://api.sandbox.datatrans.com/v1/transactions' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Basic MTEwMDAwNzI4MzpobDJST1NScUN2am5EVlJL' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \\\n    -H 'Idempotency-Key: e75d621b-0e56-4b71-b889-1acec3e9d870' \\\n    -d '{\n    \"refno\" : \"58b389331dad\",\n    \"amount\" : 1000,\n    \"currency\" : \"CHF\",\n    \"paymentMethods\" : [ \"VIS\", \"ECA\", \"PAP\" ],\n    \"option\" : {\n       \"createAlias\" : true\n    }\n}'\n```\n\n# Authentication\nAuthentication to the APIs is performed with HTTP basic authentication. Your\n`merchantId` acts as the username. To get the password, login\nto the <a href='https://admin.sandbox.datatrans.com/' target='_blank'>dashboard</a>\nand navigate to the security settings under `UPP Administration > Security`.\n\nCreate a base64 encoded value consisting of merchantId and password (most HTTP clients\nare able to handle the base64 encoding automatically) and submit the Authorization header with your requests. Here’s an example:\n\n```\nbase64(merchantId:password) = MTAwMDAxMTAxMTpYMWVXNmkjJA==\n```\n\n```\nAuthorization: Basic MTAwMDAxMTAxMTpYMWVXNmkjJA==\n````\n\nAll API requests must be done over HTTPS with TLS >= 1.2.\n\n# Errors\nDatatrans uses HTTP response codes to indicate if an API call was successful or resulted in a failure.\nHTTP `2xx` status codes indicate a successful API call whereas HTTP `4xx` status codes\nindicate client errors or if something with the transaction went wrong - for example a decline.\nIn rare cases HTTP `5xx` status codes are returned. Those indicate errors on Datatrans side.\n\nHere’s the payload of a sample HTTP `400` error, showing that your request has wrong values in it\n```\n{\n  \"error\" : {\n    \"code\" : \"INVALID_PROPERTY\",\n    \"message\" : \"init.initRequest.currency The given currency does not have the right format\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Webhook\nAfter each authorization Datatrans tries to call the configured Webhook (POST) URL. The Webhook URL\ncan be configured within the <a href='https://admin.sandbox.datatrans.com/' target='_blank'>dashboard</a>.\nIt is also possible to overwrite the configured webhook URL with the `init.webhook` property.\nThe Webhook payload contains the same information as the response of a [Status API](#operation/status) call.\n\n## Webhook signing\nIf you want your webhook requests to be signed, setup a HMAC key in your merchant configuration.\nTo get your HMAC key, login to our dashboard and navigate to the Security settings in your\nmerchant configuration to view your server to server security settings.\nSelect the radio button `Important parameters will be digitally signed (HMAC-SHA256) and sent with payment messages`.\nDatatrans will use this key to sign the webhook payload and will add a `Datatrans-Signature` HTTP request header:\n\n```sh\nDatatrans-Signature: t=1559303131511,s0=33819a1220fd8e38fc5bad3f57ef31095fac0deb38c001ba347e694f48ffe2fc\n```\n\nOn your server, calculate the signature of the webhook payload and finally compare it to `s0`.\n`timestamp` is the `t` value from the Datatrans-Signature header, `payload` represents all UTF-8 bytes\nfrom the body of the payload and finally `key` is the HMAC key you configured within the dashboard.\nIf the value of `sign` is equal to `s0` from the `Datatrans-Signature` header,\nthe webhook payload is valid and was not tampered.\n\n**Java**\n\n```java\n// hex bytes of the key\nbyte[] key = Hex.decodeHex(key);\n\n// Create sign with timestamp and payload\nString algorithm = \"HmacSha256\";\nSecretKeySpec macKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, algorithm);\nMac mac = Mac.getInstance(algorithm);\nmac.init(macKey);\nmac.update(String.valueOf(timestamp).getBytes());\nbyte[] result = mac.doFinal(payload.getBytes());\nString sign = Hex.encodeHexString(result);\n```\n\n**Python**\n\n```python\n# hex bytes of the key\nkey_hex_bytes = bytes.fromhex(key)\n\n# Create sign with timestamp and payload\nsign = hmac.new(key_hex_bytes, bytes(str(timestamp) + payload, 'utf-8'), hashlib.sha256)\n```\n\n# Release notes\n<details>\n  <summary>Details</summary>\n\n  ### 2.0.32 - 12.10.2022\n* added different `card` types `PlainCard`, `AliasCard` and `NetworkTokenCard` for the `authorize` and `init` endpoint\n  * the old card type is still supported\n* fixed `webhook.url` for mobile flows\n* improved the API docs for `statusResponse.status`\n\n### 2.0.31 - 06.10.2022\n* update API docs for `status.language` in the status response\n\n### 2.0.30 - 23.09.2022\n* added `qrData` to `MPX` and `MFX` in the status API response\n* added support for `KLN` train reservations\n* added additional `airPlus` properties\n* added the `ELV` request properties to the API docs (init and authorize API)\n* fix `MCP` sample request/response examples in the api docs\n* fix date format issues for `airPlus` properties\n\n### 2.0.29 - 17.08.2022\n* added `merchantId` to the status API response\n* added `SWH` (Swish) payment method\n* added `messageExtensions` to `init.card.3d`\n* added `authorizeResponse.card` to the API docs\n* added `GFT` (MFG Gift Card) payment method\n* added `CBL` (Cartes Bancaires) payment method\n* added `HPC` (Hipercard) payment method\n* added `airPlus` to the init API request\n* added more languages to the `init.language` API docs\n* cleaned up `order.article` property\n* extended the init flow to work also with tokenization mode\n* improved the api docs for the `credit` api\n* no `card` object is returned in the `alias` info response if the content is empty\n* fix the status api now also returns the `externalCode` for `INT` transactions\n* fix enrollment check in `init` api if `init.number` is set with plain card number\n* fix handle `airlineData` date format issues\n\n### 2.0.28 - 23.05.2022\n* Added support to send a webhook URL along the init request.

The success result of this API call is a `HTTP 201` status code with a `transactionId` in the response body.\n- Initialize the `SecureFields` JavaScript library with the returned `transactionId`:\n```js\nvar secureFields = new SecureFields();\nsecureFields.init(\n    transactionId, {\n        cardNumber: \"cardNumberPlaceholder\",\n        cvv: \"cvvPlaceholder\",\n    });\n```\n- Handle the `success` event of the `secureFields.submit()` call.

This is required to finalize the authorization process with Secure Fields.\n- Use the `transactionId` to check the [status](#operation/status) and to [settle](#operation/settle), [cancel](#operation/cancel) or [credit (refund)](#operation/refund) an transaction.",
